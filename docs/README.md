# VCH Palliative Documentation

## Welcome
This is the documentation for the VCH Palliative Assistant Tool created by [Learning Technologies](http://vchdesign.ca/).  PAT is made up of three parts: PAT, the API, and PAPI.

## PAT
The VCH Palliative Assistance Tool (PAT) is an iOS application that assists Palliative nurses.  It acts as a documentation tool that ensures nurses follow standardized procedures.  It is populated using data from the Palliative API (PAPI).

## API
The API is provided by a [Directus](https://docs.directus.io/) instance that provides [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) functionality through a RESTful JSON interface.

## PAPI
PAPI is a tool created to help edit the API in a more intuitive and user friendly way than using the Directus backend.  Due to time constraints the current version of PAPI is broken and does not work with the current version of the API.  All Data modification must be done through Directus at them moment.
