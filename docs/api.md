# API

## Intro

The Palliative Directus instance provides a RESTful JSON API can that be accessed at [https://api.palliative.vchlearn.ca/_/](https://api.palliative.vchlearn.ca/_/)

The "/_/" tells PAPI to respond with the default project endpoint where the palliative information is stored.

This is further explained in the [üê∞Directus Docs](https://docs.directus.io/api/reference.html#introduction) and in the backend section of this documentation.
    
## (GET)ing the Data

For PAT, we have created a custom, read-only, api endpoint that provides all neccesary data to run the PAT application.  This can be found here:

[https://api.palliative.vchlearn.ca/_/custom/bundle](https://api.palliative.vchlearn.ca/_/custom/bundle)

### Additional Notes on the Response above

#### info.version
PAT Will only download a new copy of this data if the version number is incremented, this happens automatically when using PAPI but must be done manually if editing content using the Directus Admin Interface
